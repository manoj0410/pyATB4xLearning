# -Q.1 Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# Ans = operator is assignment operator is used to declare or assign value to variables.
# while == is comparision operator is used to check the condition.
# Q.2 - What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# Ans: ** operator is used to find the power of number e.g 2**3=8
num = (8 ^ 4) #Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# The ^ operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if only one is 1,
# otherwise (if both are 1 or both are 0) it is set to 0:
print(num)
# print(pow(2 , 5))
# print(abs(-5))
print(bin(8))
print(bin(4))
